## Description
The application search for a word you add on the search bar. It will show you the descriptions with the part of speech (noun, verb etc.). At the bottom of descriptions, you will see buttons for examples of senteces and synonyms/antonyms. In addition, I added text to speech functionality. In this application, you can add words, phrases and sentences and they will be converted to natural-sounding speech. It is available in 27 voices (13 neural and 14 standard) across 7 languages. The text language must match the selected voice language: Mixing language (English text with a Spanish male voice) does not produce valid results.
